Linear function intution:
if experience is given as input and we have to find the salary of the person based on the hypothesis that 
y = mx + c
we know y and x but slope(m) and y-intercept(c) is unknown the model will iteratte and tries to find the optimal values 
for the m and c.

Forward propogation and cost function in linear regression:
cost function is measured by takeing the square of diff between actual and predicted data.

Gradient decent:
It is found by  taking the partial derivation of the cost fucntion with respec to m and c.
 And it then take it to closest to the actual.
